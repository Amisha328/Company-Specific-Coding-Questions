// Problem Statement â€“ 
// An automobile company manufactures both a two wheeler (TW) and a four wheeler (FW). 
// A company manager wants to make the production of both types of vehicle according to the given data below:

// 1st data, Total number of vehicle (two-wheeler + four-wheeler)=v
// 2nd data, Total number of wheels = W
 
// The task is to find how many two-wheelers as well as four-wheelers need to manufacture as per the given data.

// Example :

// Input :

// 200  -> Value of V
// 540   -> Value of W
// Output :

// TW = 130 FW = 70

// Explanation:

// 130+70 = 200 vehicles

// (70*4)+(130*2)= 540 wheels

// Constraints :

// 2<=W
// W%2=0
// V<W
